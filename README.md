# C_programs

Notes:

1. For True c uses 1
2. For false c uses 0
3. Increment and Decrement (++) (--) only works with variables not with constants
4. Unary operators have associativity right to left
5. In C every lines is a line if it has ';' to denote its end
6. Switch only works with integers and character constants, no variable is allowed unles evaluates to constant.
7. Array name is a constant pointer i.e stores the actual starting addres of the array.
8. In C by default call by value is used in function calling.
9. C supports Abstraction but not data hiding, abstraction means hiding irrrevelant details from user whereas data hiding is hiding relevant dateils from the users.
