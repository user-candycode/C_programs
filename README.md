# C_programs

Notes:

1. For True c uses 1
2. For false c uses 0
3. Increment and Decrement (++) (--) only works with variables not with constants
4. Unary operators have associativity right to left
5. In C every lines is a line if it has ';' to denote its end
6. Switch only works with integers and character constants, no variable is allowed unles evaluates to constant.
